This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebook based on the original
[nMoldyn program](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23035). A Molecular dynamics
trajectory (box of water molecules) is used for the computation of the time
series analyses.


## 1. msd.ipynb

(MSD).

## 2. vacf.ipynb

Comparing the velocity and Velocity Auto-Correlation Function (VACF) for
oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

## 3. dos.ipynb

Compute the Density Of States (DOS) for oxygen and hydrogen atoms.
